When I started to solve a problem , that's not solve in onetime , it's take minimum 2 to 3 attempts.

Jyotismita Das is a sweet guys to work with a great intension. But the reality is ,I am from tire 3 college.
At where no one focus on practical knowledge as well as theoretical also.
So I totally dependable on using internet to solving my all problems.
I know that hardwork dosen't matter where are you from,it's only depends on your patience level.
good morning/afternoon/night happy_reader.
